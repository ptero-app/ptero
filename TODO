TODO

Kept as a simple text file because this is just a small personal project,
and I don't want to deal with a full project tracker for just myself right now.


---------------------
Nice to have features
---------------------

- Ability to select which accounts to post to
- Ability to delete just a single credential
- Ability to initiate the mastodon login oauth flow
    So that people don't need to setup development apps
- Create threads (like the twitter app)
- Ability to re-order images, or remove them

- Better styles (current version is functional, would like to make it prettier)
