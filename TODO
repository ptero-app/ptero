TODO
----

Kept as a simple text file because this is just a small personal project,
and I don't want to deal with a full project tracker for just myself right now.


------------------
Ordered Priorities
------------------

- Add better styling
    Especially for the post form


---------------------
Nice to have features
---------------------

- Support for multiple images in posts
- Ability to select which accounts to post to
- Ability to edit credentials / delete just a single credential
- Ability to initiate the mastodon login oauth flow
    So that people don't need to setup development apps
- Create threads (like the twitter app)
